## What is a Signal ?
A signal is a function representing a
physical quantity.

Mathematically, signals are represented as functions of
one or more independent variables.

## Classification of Signals (Continuity)
Mathematically, a signal is represented as a function of time $x(t)$
### Continuous-Time Signals (CT)
- The independent variable $t$ is continuous.
- The signal values are defined for all $t$ in the interval of interest.
- It's denoted as $x(t)$.
- **Example:** volt or current.

### Discrete Time Signal (DT)
- The independent variable $t$ is discrete.
- It takes only a discrete values $n$ where $n$ is an integer.
- It's denoted as $x(nTs)$ or $x(n)$, Ts
is the sampling time.
- It results from sampling of (CT) signal.

## Applications of Discrete Time Signals
Discrete time signals are used to convert the analog signal to digital data using
the following operations:

1) **Sampling**: Convert the message signal to samples (by multiplying by impulses).
2) **Quantization**: Converting of samples to a set of discrete amplitudes.
3) **Binary encoding**: Translating the discrete set of samples into digital data. 

## Classification of Signals (Type of Number)
- **Real Signals**: $x(t)$ is a real signal if its value is a real number!
- **Complex Signals**: $x(t)$ is a complex signal if its value is a complex number

## Classifications of Signals (Randomness)
- **Deterministic Signals**: Whose values are completely specified for any given time.
- **Random Signals**: Take random values at any given time and must be characterized statistically.

## Classifications of Signals (Periodicity)
- Periodic Signals: It's signals that repeats a specific period.
- Non-Periodic Signals: It's signals that don't repeat.

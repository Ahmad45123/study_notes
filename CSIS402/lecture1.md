## Decoders
Decodes a number in binary to a single line of output. ![picture 3](assets/lecture1-decoders.png)  

## D-Flipflop
- A D-Flipflop is a memory element that can be used to store 1 bit.
- The output Q is equal to the input D on the clock edge. 
- During the clock period, Q retains its value despite the input changing.

## Registers
When a set of n-flipflops are connected together to store n-bit peice of information, we refer to the set of flipflops as Registers!

A common clock is user for all the registers!

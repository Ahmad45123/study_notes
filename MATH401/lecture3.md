# Counting Rules
- **Multiplication Rule**: In a sequence of two experiments, if the first experiment can occur in $m$ ways and the second can occur in $n$ different ways, then the sequence can occur in $m * n$ different ways.
- The number of ways to arrange $n$ items is $n!$
- To select $r$ items from $n$ items and order is not needed, we use $rCn$
- To select $r$ items from $n$ items and order is important, we use $rPn$
- $nPr = nCr \cdot r!$
- Sometimes, certain items must be kept together, to do such a request you must consider the "joint" as if they are only one object.
- When presented with multiple groups of items from which you are required to make a selection, you will multiply the separate cases together.
- At Least / At Most: requires that you ADD all the possible cases together. But, you should not forget the shortcut way: [At Least / At Most = the “all” case – unwanted cases].
